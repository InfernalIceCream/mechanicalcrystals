Mechanicalcrystals - Assignment from university modelling the displacement over a variety of frequencies.

A periodic array of solid layers of material, with varying mass densities and
elasticities, is being used to try to damp mechanical oscillations (for exampe,
to prevent sound transmission). The problem treats all the spatial variation as
being in one direction, so it is spatially 1D. Note that this problem is closely
related to, for example, x-ray wave scattering from crystals: hence the idea of
a mechanical crystal.
The quantity of interest is the displacement h(x, t) from equilibrium as a
function of position x in this structure and time t, that results due to an external
force, which is sinusoidal in both position and space, F(x, t) = exp(i[Kx - wt])
applied to the material. The displacement and force are written using complex
variables, and the code will output these complex values: physical interpretation
(which is not required for this assignment) requires taking the real parts of these
variables.
